## Mining in Territory (aka Origin Space)

There are a limited number of nodes in our territories. We have a very active and competitive alliance. To provide an equitable chance for everyone, weâ€™ve provided these guidelines:

- Please be mindful of zero nodes and reset them and/or leave to allow someone else a chance to mine
- One ship max in each of our 3* or 5* node systems
- All Isogen systems you may mine with multiple ships
- Two ships max in each 4* node systems of crystal, ore, or gas
- Officers reserve the right to call in an airstrike from Allies to clear out nodes if we have a system full of zero nodes or repeat offenders of multiple ship rules

**Event-specific limits (superseding other guidelines):**
- *Event hours for Mining Monday:* One ship max in each system of crystal, ore, or gas
- *Event hours for an Isogen Mining Event:* One ship max in each Isogen system
